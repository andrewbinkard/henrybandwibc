    programName: "About the Henry Middle School Band Program",
    programInfo: `The Henry Middle School Band serves more than 300 students, offering three performing ensembles for seventh- and eighth-grade musicians, along with beginning band classes for sixth graders in a homogeneous setting.

    Since the school’s opening in 2002, the Artie Henry bands have established a tradition of excellence. They are consistent UIL Sweepstakes winners and are regularly represented at Solo and Ensemble contests, TMEA All-Region Band, and Region Orchestra auditions. The bands have also earned numerous honors at festivals across Texas.

    In 2008 and 2013, the program was invited to perform at the prestigious Western International Band Clinic in Seattle, Washington. The HMS Band Program was named the Texas Class CCC Honor Band in 2010, 2014, 2018, and 2024, and in 2010, 2012, 2016, and 2022, the bands performed at the Midwest International Band and Orchestra Clinic in Chicago. In 2011, the program was awarded the coveted John Philip Sousa Foundation Sudler Silver Cup Award.

    The program’s ensembles have also been recognized for groundbreaking achievements. In 2014, the HMS Percussion Ensemble became the first middle school percussion ensemble ever invited to perform at the Percussive Arts Society International Convention in Indianapolis. That same year, the Texas Chapter of the American School Band Directors Association named the Artie Henry MS Band Program as its Outstanding Band Program Award winner. From 2009 to 2025, the Honors Band earned recognition as a National Wind Band Honors Class AA winner, while the Symphonic and Concert Bands received Citation of Excellence honors in 2016, 2017, and 2022–2025. In 2018, the program was awarded the Texas Bandmasters Association Exemplary Middle School Band Award, and in 2023, it was named a National Band Association Programs of Excellence Blue Ribbon Award winner.

    Beyond awards, the program emphasizes individual growth. All HMS Band students participate in weekly section rehearsals, and many choose to study privately through the LISD Private Lesson Program. Students also participate in a wide range of other school activities, including National Junior Honor Society, Student Council, Leadership, Yearbook/Journalism, Athletics, Art, Cheerleading, Dance Team, and Theatre.

    Through the dedication of its students, directors, and community, the Henry Middle School Band Program has built a legacy of musical excellence and continues to thrive as a source of pride for the school and its community.
