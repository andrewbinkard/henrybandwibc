    time: "3:40",
    details: `From the composer: Ocean Blue is inspired by the beauty and diversity of life in Earth’s breathtaking oceans. I wrote this piece with a marine-life trailer in mind, taking snapshots of life within the ocean.

    The music begins by exploring the seafloor, hinting at the calm and mysterious creatures that inhabit the deep. The camera slowly pans upward, capturing the light pouring into the ocean from the sky. As the tempo increases, the music bursts through the waves and we are majestically sailing alongside dolphins and whales. The texture thins halfway through to feature some of the calmer moments, only to once again pan out across the ocean to see schools of fish and large whales swimming by. The piece ends in cinematic fashion, hinting at the potential for exploring other regions of the ocean. Each sea creature has its own story, and this music attempts to capture that.

    To me, the piece deeply resonates with the color ocean blue itself, depicting joy, serenity, and tranquility.`,

    title: "West Highlands Sojourn",
    composer: "Robert Sheldon",
    publisher: "C.L. Barnhouse Company",
    publisherWebsiteURL: "https://barnhouse.com/product/012-2513-00/",
    year: "1993",
    grade: "3",
    time: "6:21",
    details: `West Highlands Sojourn is a three-movement musical journey through the landscapes and folk influences of western England and Wales. The composer drew inspiration directly from village visits and local folk traditions, weaving them into a score that blends character, lyricism, and rhythmic vitality.

    I. Stow-on-the-Wold
    This opening movement captures the spirit of a quaint market town, full of charm and rustic life. Its light, jaunty character suggests walking through stone streets, stopping at cafés and shops, and breathing in the quiet countryside.

    II. Bradford Ballade
    Here the mood slows and softens. The music evokes a quiet evening stroll along lantern-lit streams and rolling hills. It’s lyrical, introspective, and elegantly crafted to evoke both calmness and reflection.
    
    III. On Derwentwater
    Drawing from folk dance rhythms heard near Derwentwater in the Lake District, this movement introduces more rhythmic drive and interplay. Sheldon uses hemiolic shifts between brass and woodwinds to create a playful, spirited finale that recalls the folk dance tradition.

    composer: "Brian Balmages",
    publisher: "Alfred Music Publishing",

      "https://www.alfred.com/a-life-worth-living/p/00-50668/?srsltid=AfmBOoqfxT1ntRvRqnyJqYXrHAaTbxJyfSeaUBSDqmZ8LKJYP5nxgAy0",
    year: "2023",
    grade: "2.5 - 3",
    time: "5:07",
    details: `From Mr. Balmages: Mental health has rightfully become an important part of conversations throughout the world, and very slowly, societies are starting to remove the stigma associated with it. When Taylor Williamson (director of bands at Wiley Middle School in Leander, Texas) approached me about writing a piece for their honor band performance at TMEA, he was very clear about the reasons behind the commission. His brother-in-law, Justin, had been a high school star athlete and was liked by everyone. He brought a special light into the world, had a wonderful wife and two children. What people did not know was that Justin had been going through a dark journey over many years, struggling with alcoholism and mental illness. Despite being surrounded by family trying to help him and entering several rehab facilities, Justin constantly feared that he was a burden to everyone around him. Justin ultimately succumbed to his mental illness in November 2021.

    In writing this piece, I wanted to accomplish several things. First, I wanted to help Justin’s family process their loss and bring something beautiful into the world to honor him and the rest of their family. I also wanted this to be a piece that lets everyone know their life is worth living, that they do matter, and that every single person can make an impact. But I also wanted to take it a step further. My family and I love to vacation in Stone Harbor, a beautiful beach on the New Jersey Shore. As you leave the island, there is some artwork on the side of a building that reminds us to “Live a Life You’d Relive.” This is how the title A Life Worth Living came to be.

    This piece is a strong reminder to all of us that we should live our best and fullest lives as much as possible. It is a reminder to students that we don’t take popularity with us when we leave this world, nor do we take possessions. Our lives can be defined by the impact we make on those around us, by how we choose to bring beauty into the world, by how we care for others in need, and by the relationships we cultivate, the people we inspire, and how we lift up those who may not be able to lift themselves up. A life worth living, or reliving, is the most beautiful thing we can strive for and truly helps recenter our priorities.

    As the music starts, it is very transparent and ethereal with moments of brightness throughout. What follows is complicated, mildly dissonant, but still an “attempt” at being positive. Nonetheless, it feels like a struggle back and forth between darkness and light until the music becomes unmistakably beautiful, leading into the first statement of the main theme (which takes over 2 minutes to arrive). Tonal centers shift as the music develops, and a massive amount of tension is finally released in an amazing moment of strength and clarity. The music then retreats as it becomes more contemplative, ending with a final spark of sound that seems to last forever.

    year: "2024",
    grade: "3",
    time: "5:00",
    details: `From the composer: In 1925, a deadly outbreak in Nome, Alaska, endangered thousands of lives. The cure was an antitoxin serum that could only be delivered by dogsled across a portion of the Iditarod Trail—the only route accessible for transporting goods during the harsh winters. A heroic relay of dog teams transported hundreds of boxes of the life-saving serum across the 674-mile trail from Nenana to Nome in a record-breaking 127.5 hours, without a single broken vial. This came to be known as the 1925 Serum Run, commemorated annually by the Iditarod Race.

    Across the Alaskan Snow echoes this famous race’s riveting rush at the start, the dauntless determination of the sled dogs, and the awe-inspiring serenity of the Alaskan landscape. This voyage is a testament to perseverance, courage, and the bond between driver and dog—for victory is granted not to the swift nor the strong, but to those who endure to the end.`,

    year: "2024",
    grade: "2.5",
    time: "4:00",
    details: `Thawing evokes the subtle and gradual process of nature emerging from winter’s hold. The music suggests frozen stillness at its outset—icelike textures, sparse sonorities, and restrained dynamics. Gradually, warmth infiltrates: harmonies soften, rhythms awaken, and motifs begin to stretch, as if ice cracking and water flowing anew. The piece celebrates transformation and renewal, inviting listeners to sense the fragile threshold between dormancy and rebirth. Through contrast, pacing, and textural layering, Thawing becomes a meditation on change, resilience, and the promise held in the delicate stirrings of life’s return.`,

    year: "2020",
    grade: "2.5",
    time: "2:26",
    conductor: "Cynthia Lansford",
    details: `The title Kvetchers—a colloquial Yiddish-derived term meaning “complainers”—serves as a playful wink to the music’s character. Estes’s march is humorous in spirit: each section is designed with its own surprise twist, making it a fun showcase for independent section interplay and lighthearted musical dialogue. Though written in march form, it deliberately subverts expectations, turning familiar gestures into musical jokes. Through these surprises, the piece encourages both performers and listeners to stay alert—every moment might reveal a new turn, a comedic cue, or a sly rhythmic twist.`,

    year: "2012",
    grade: "3",
    time: "3:30",
    conductor: "Brian Perez",
    details: `In Archipelagos, composer Dave Hall offers a musical vision of scattered islands, each with its own identity yet part of a greater whole. The piece explores interlocking rhythms and resonant timbres to evoke landmasses surrounded by water—sometimes isolated, sometimes connected by currents or shared material. Solo voices drift in and out like ocean winds, while ensemble textures swell and recede like tides. Over the course of the work, the interplay between separation and unity becomes central: islands that at first feel solitary gradually reveal connections through shared motifs, harmonic bridges, or rhythmic alignment. The result is a sonic archipelago—a network of musical places that invites discovery and reflection on distance, community, and the spaces between.`,

    year: "2025",
    grade: "3",
    time: "3:10",
    details: `Saddle Up! was written for the Henry Middle School Honors Band’s 2025 performance at the Western International Band Clinic. The piece draws inspiration from the soundtracks of classic spaghetti westerns, blending sweeping lyricism with rugged energy. A moody introduction gives way to a bold main theme first stated by the flute, evoking the unmistakable spirit of Ennio Morricone’s western scores. A faster, rhythmic section follows—full of drive and dust—before returning to a soulful trumpet solo and powerful full-ensemble chorale. The final reprise gallops toward a triumphant close, as the ensemble rides off into the musical sunset: confident, daring, and free.`,
